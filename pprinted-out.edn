Entries in a Solar’s scent library can be used to aid in Investigation and Survival rolls, as well as in the smell-based Awareness Charms further up the tree. This Charm also creates a taste index. Similar to the scent library, the taste index allows the Exalt to immediately recognize any taste she has experienced within the realm of reason. The Solar can identify obscure, complex, or similar flavors and she can deconstruct a meal she has eaten to its basic ingredients, so long as she has experienced most of the flavors at some point in time. The taste index isn’t populated the same way as the scent library; most characters do not have Major or Defining intimacies for flavors. Rather, the Solar may perfectly recognize any flavor the Storyteller considers reasonable. If the character has been a master chef all of her life, her palate is going to be considerably more robust than that of an islander with little contact with the outside world.

This Charm also confers the following techniques to the Solar: Conjure Image: For one mote, the Exalt can visualize an object she is touching, in sections no larger than a horse’s head. She can identify a familiar face in a pitch black crypt, but might need several activations to visualize the fossil skeleton of an ancient behemoth in a lightless cavern. Sense Current: For one mote, the Exalt can feel the lightest motion of air, orienting herself to the exit in even the most lightless of conditions. Read the Web: For five motes committed, the Exalt can listen in on a conversation behind a thick door, just by touching a connecting wall or surface. She feels the vibrations in her fingertips, and her senses translate them to words she can hear. This is a scene length effect, and its range can be extended up to (Essence x100) yards by running a wire from the Exalt’s fingertips into a chamber where her targets are speaking. Sound from Stillness Meditation: For six motes, one Willpower, the Solar can take a Simple action lasting five minutes to filter Creation, listening for specific sounds or conversations that have already happened. The Exalt draws audio from the vibrations of sounds stored in her surroundings—usually rocks and trees—and may listen for noises or conversations that happened up to (Essence x5) hours prior to her arrival with a difficulty 5 Awareness roll. For the duration of the technique, the Solar must remain still, listening intently as she filters out the garbled static and unwanted sounds to reach the reverberations she’s searching for.
